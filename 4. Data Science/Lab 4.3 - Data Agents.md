    - The NYC Taxi Lakehouse is wher eyou cna find information in relation to taxi rides and trips. This will help make sure you are getting things related to specifc fares and all reatled data to the fares

    The WWImporter_560 is a semantic model for the worldwide importers company. In here you will find things realted to sales, customers, and products related to those sales. This is in the form of facts and dimenions and key fields should eb used to join between tbales

    The SFTech_DWSample is a data warehous esample of data that is related to a private car service. While it is similar to taxi this is not related and should focus on trips and medallions which ar considered the private town car people would take for their trip.

    - Finding the top customers for sales
    
    Select top 1 cust.Customer, sum(sales.UnitPrice)*sum(sales.Quantity) as TotalRevenue from 
dbo.dimension_customer cust
inner JOIN
dbo.fact_sale sales 
on cust.CustomerKey = sales.CustomerKey
group by cust.Customer
order by TotalRevenue

    - FInding trips by year
    
    Select *  FROM [dbo].[Trip] T
JOIN [dbo].[Date] D ON T.DateID = D.DateID
WHERE D.Year BETWEEN '2010' AND '2015';
    - Number of taxi rides for a given year

    SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalRides
FROM [year_2019].[green_tripdata_2019];

    - Medallions Trips

    SELECT MedallionCode, count(DateID) totaltrips
FROM [SFtech_DWSample].[dbo].[Medallion] med
inner join dbo.Trip trip 
on med.MedallionID = trip.MedallionID
group by MedallionCode

3. Retest questions, also try the follwoing
