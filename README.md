# Microsoft Fabric Introduction
A hands on journey to learn about the different areas of Microsoft Fabric.

## Overview
Welcome to the Microsoft Fabric Hands-On Lab! This guide is designed to provide a practical and engaging introduction to Microsoft Fabric through a structured series of exercises and demonstrations. Whether you're a data engineer, analyst, or architect, this lab will give you a foundational understanding of Fabric’s unified data platform.

What is Microsoft Fabric?
Microsoft Fabric is an end-to-end analytics platform that brings together powerful capabilities for data engineering, data science, real-time analytics, and business intelligence. Built on a SaaS foundation and deeply integrated with Microsoft 365 and Power BI, Fabric helps teams unify data across various sources and deliver insights faster.

Why Leverage Microsoft Fabric?
- Unified experience: Combines Lakehouse, Data Factory, Synapse Data Warehouse, Power BI, and more in a single platform.
- Simplified architecture: OneLake as a single data lake reduces duplication and silos.
- Accelerated time to insight: Native integration with Power BI and Microsoft 365 for fast, business-ready dashboards.
- Security & governance: Integrated with Microsoft Purview for enterprise-grade data governance.
- Open & extensible: Supports Spark, SQL, Python, and Delta Lake formats.

Key Benefits
- Reduce infrastructure complexity
- Enable self-service analytics and governance
- Improve collaboration across data and business teams
- Streamline data ingestion, transformation, and reporting
- Lower TCO with a SaaS-native data platform

 Considerations Before Adopting Fabric
- Licensing & capacity-based pricing
- Maturity of real-time ingestion features
- Learning curve for Spark-based tools
- Integration needs with existing on-prem/cloud ecosystems
- Governance and security configuration across workspaces
